## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Using Chocolatey (Recommended)

If you have Chocolatey installed, this is the easiest method:

```

### Method 2: Using Scoop

If you prefer Scoop package manager:

```bash
scoop install hugo-extended
```

### Method 3: Manual Installation

2. Download the latest Windows binary
3. Extract the executable to a folder in your PATH

## Verification
